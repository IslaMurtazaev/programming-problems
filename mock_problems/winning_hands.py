Game where you receive 14 cards.
Want to know if you can win the game by making hands with the following possibilities.

pair: [11, 22...]
set: [111, 222, 333]
street: [123, 456, 789]

To win, you need 1 pair and 4 sets and/or streets.
And have to use all 14 cards.

use backtracking
take each key and use it as a pair:
    remaining values are sent to sets/streets recursion function -> that validates that all values can be used to build 4 triplets

    use first value as set and triplet_builder(remaining part)
    use first value as street and triplet_builder(remaining part)

"""
Questions and insights I expected to hear: 
Can we use one card in multiple combinations?
We should use all 14 cards to collect all combinations.
It looks like we can break down the problem into subproblems -> maybe use recursion here.
It's easier to start with 1 pair and then do recursive steps for 4 sets/streets.
We might have chosen the wrong pair, so we need some way to backtrack and choose another one.
